As Pandemic sparked , almost everyone required funds , with shortage of injections , oxygen and even hospital beds , India witnessed itâ€™s huge healthcare system collapse , this increased the need of fundraisers as well as other online campaigns . However not just seeing the brighter side  , there were a lot of fraud fundraisers too .
This is when I realized that a secure , transparent crowdfunding application is the need of hour .

According to Recent Stats , The high out-of-pocket expenses in India stem from
the fact that 76 percent of Indians do not have health insurance.
7% of Indians fall below the poverty line just because of
indebtedness due to health expenses.
As a result, about 23% of sick cannot afford healthcare. People like Dhruv go to fundraisers however are afraid and refrain from trusting crowdfunding
